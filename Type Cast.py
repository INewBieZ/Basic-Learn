#type casting = convert the data type of a value to another data type

#x = 1   #int
#y = 2.0 #float
#z = "3" #str cant perform any math on strings

#y = int(y)
#this is how to change it permanently
#z = int(z)

#print(x)
#print(y)
#print(int(y))
#print(z*3) = 333 because its a string
#print(z*3) = 9 because now its a int

#when you need to change int or float to str
#that is when we need to print it with a string
#print("X is " +str(x)) = this how to do it
#print("Y is " +y) = it will give an error
